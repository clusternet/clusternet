# Deploying Applications to Multiple Clusters

Clusternet supports deploying applications to multiple clusters from a single set of APIs in a hosting cluster.

## Defining Your Applications

First, let's see an exmaple application. Below `Subscription` "app-demo" defines the target child clusters to be
distributed to, and the resources to be deployed with.

```yaml
# examples/applications/subscription.yaml
apiVersion: apps.clusternet.io/v1alpha1
kind: Subscription
metadata:
  name: app-demo
  namespace: default
spec:
  subscribers: # defines the clusters to be distributed to
    - clusterAffinity:
        matchLabels:
          clusters.clusternet.io/cluster-id: dc91021d-2361-4f6d-a404-7c33b9e01118 # PLEASE UPDATE THIS CLUSTER-ID TO YOURS!!!
  feeds: # defines all the resources to be deployed with
    - apiVersion: apps.clusternet.io/v1alpha1
      kind: HelmChart
      name: mysql
      namespace: default
    - apiVersion: v1
      kind: Namespace
      name: foo
    - apiVersion: apps/v1
      kind: Service
      name: my-nginx-svc
      namespace: foo
    - apiVersion: apps/v1
      kind: Deployment
      name: my-nginx
      namespace: foo
```

Before applying this `Subscription`, please
modify [examples/applications/subscription.yaml](https://github.com/clusternet/clusternet/blob/main/examples/applications/subscription.yaml)
with your clusterID.

> If you want to install a helm chart from a private helm repository, please set a valid `chartPullSecret` by referring
> [this example](../../deploy/templates/helm-chart-private-repo.yaml).

## Setting Overrides

`Clusternet` also provides a ***two-stage priority based*** override strategy. You can define
namespace-scoped `Localization` and cluster-scoped `Globalization` with priorities (ranging from 0 to 1000, default to
be 500), where lower numbers are considered lower priority. These Globalization(s) and Localization(s) will be applied
by order from lower priority to higher. That means override values in lower `Globalization` will be overridden by those
in higher `Globalization`. Globalization(s) come first and then Localization(s).

> :dizzy: :dizzy: For example,
>
> Globalization (priority: 100) -> Globalization (priority: 600) -> Localization (priority: 100) -> Localization (priority 500)

Meanwhile, below override policies are supported,

- `ApplyNow` will apply overrides for matched objects immediately, including those are already populated.
- Default override policy `ApplyLater` will only apply override for matched objects on next updates (including updates
  on `Subscription`, `HelmChart`, etc) or new created objects.

Before applying these Localization(s), please
modify [examples/applications/localization.yaml](https://github.com/clusternet/clusternet/blob/main/examples/applications/localization.yaml)
with your `ManagedCluster` namespace, such as `clusternet-5l82l`.

## Applying Your Applications

After installing kubectl plugin [kubectl-clusternet](https://github.com/clusternet/kubectl-clusternet), you could run
below commands to distribute this application to child clusters.

```bash
$ kubectl clusternet apply -f examples/applications/
helmchart.apps.clusternet.io/mysql created
namespace/foo created
deployment.apps/my-nginx created
service/my-nginx-svc created
subscription.apps.clusternet.io/app-demo created
$ # or
$ # kubectl-clusternet apply -f examples/applications/
```

## Checking Status

Then you can view the resources just created,

```bash
$ # list Subscription
$ kubectl clusternet get subs -A
NAMESPACE   NAME       AGE
default     app-demo   6m4s
$ kubectl clusternet get chart
NAME             CHART   VERSION   REPO                                 STATUS   AGE
mysql            mysql   8.6.2     https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami   Found    71s
$ kubectl clusternet get ns
NAME   CREATED AT
foo    2021-08-07T08:50:55Z
$ kubectl clusternet get svc -n foo
NAME           CREATED AT
my-nginx-svc   2021-08-07T08:50:57Z
$ kubectl clusternet get deploy -n foo
NAME       CREATED AT
my-nginx   2021-08-07T08:50:56Z
```

`Clusternet` will help deploy and coordinate applications to multiple clusters. You can check the status by following
commands,

```bash
$ kubectl clusternet get mcls -A
NAMESPACE          NAME                       CLUSTER ID                             SYNC MODE   KUBERNETES   READYZ   AGE

```

You can also verify the installation with Helm command line in your child cluster,

```bash
$ helm ls -n abc
NAME               	NAMESPACE	REVISION	UPDATED                             	STATUS  	CHART            	APP VERSION

```

> Admission webhooks could be configured in parent cluster, but please make sure that [dry-run](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/extensible-admission-controllers/#side-effects) mode is supported in these webhooks. At the same time, a webhook must explicitly indicate that it will not have side-effects when running with `dryRun`. That is [`sideEffects`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/extensible-admission-controllers/#side-effects) must be set to `None` or `NoneOnDryRun`.

> While, these webhooks could be configured per child cluster without above limitations as well.
