# Developer Guide

First, please make sure you've got a working [Go environment](https://golang.org/doc/install)
and [Docker environment](https://docs.docker.com/engine).

## Clone Clusternet

Clone the repository,

```bash
mkdir -p $GOPATH/src/github.com/clusternet/
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/clusternet/
git clone https://github.com/clusternet/clusternet
cd clusternet
```

## Building Binaries

Run

```bash
# build for linux/amd64 by default
$ make clusternet-agent clusternet-hub clusternet-scheduler
```

to build binaries `clusternet-agent`, `clusternet-hub` and `clusternet-scheduler` for `linux/amd64`.

Also you could specify other platforms when building, such as,

```bash
# build only clusternet-agent for linux/arm64 and darwin/amd64
# use comma to separate multiple platforms
$ PLATFORMS=linux/arm64,darwin/amd64 make clusternet-agent
# below are all the supported platforms
# PLATFORMS=darwin/amd64,darwin/arm64,linux/amd64,linux/arm64,linux/ppc64le,linux/s390x,linux/386,linux/arm
```

All the built binaries will be placed at `_output` folder.

## Building Docker Images

You can also build docker images. Here `docker buildx` is used to help build multi-arch container images.

If you're running MacOS, please install [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/) and then check the builder,

```bash
$ docker buildx ls
NAME/NODE DRIVER/ENDPOINT STATUS  PLATFORMS
default * docker
  default default         running linux/amd64, linux/arm64, linux/ppc64le, linux/s390x, linux/386, linux/arm/v7, linux/arm/v6
```

If you're running Linux, please refer to [docker buildx docs](https://docs.docker.com/buildx/working-with-buildx/)
on the installation.

> Note:
>
> For better `docker buildx` support, it is recommended to use Ubuntu Focal 20.04 (LTS), Debian Bullseye 11 and CentOS 8.
>
> And install deb/rpm package `qemu-user-static` as well, such as
> ```bash
> apt-get install qemu-user-static
> ```
> or
> ```bash
> yum install qemu-user-static
> ```

```bash
# build for linux/amd64 by default
# container images for clusternet-agent, clusternet-hub and clusternet-scheduler
$ make images
```

Also you could build container images for other platforms, such as `arm64`,

```bash
$ PLATFORMS=linux/amd64,linux/arm64,linux/ppc64le make images
# below are all the supported platforms
# PLATFORMS=linux/amd64,linux/arm64,linux/ppc64le,linux/s390x,linux/386,linux/arm
```
